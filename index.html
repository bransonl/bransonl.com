				<h1>2</h1>
				<p>2 is a real-time multiplayer Big 2 web-app capable of handling multiple simultaneous games in separate rooms. It also has a built in chat allowing players to communicate with one another during a game. It has a spectator functionality, giving people a way to watch games even if the room is full, the game is in progress or if they simply do not want to play. There is also a player substitution feature where players can swap in a spectator to play in their place.</p>
				<p>The server provides a variety of commands depending on the person's role of host, player or spectator, with most restricted to the host of the room. The commands' functions include starting, pausing, resuming, ending, and restarting a game, transferring host privileges, substituting players, changing roles, and leaving a room. Information on these commands can be retrieved using /help in the chat box.</p>
				<p>The front end is built with AngularJS to take advantage of controllers and directives for different aspects of the game. Controllers are used to change page functionality for the two possible screens, the room joining screen and the game sceen. Modularization and repeated usage of the different aspects of the game screen is done by leveraging the use of directives, ie. player hands, board, settings and chat. The back end uses Node.js with Express and Socket.io to handle web-sockets and allow simultaneous real-time connections separated by room.</p>
				<p>The game can be found at <a href="http://bransonl.com/2">bransonl.com/2</a> and the source code at the <a href="https://github.com/bransonl/2">Github repository</a>.</p>

				<h1>Bulletin</h1>
				<p>Bulletin is a group-based bulletin board web-app. The idea is for multiple users to have shared bulletin boards where each user can create new, edit existing or delete posts on the board. These posts are then displayed, grouped and coloured based on user created groups and with size depending on the importance of the post set by the user. By doing so, users are presented information in an organized way to maximize efficiency bygiving the most important items more presence while grouping relevant items in visually distinct groups.</p>
				<p>The front end is built with AngularJS using D3.js Treemap to visualize the posts. The back end uses Node.js with Express and will use a PostgreSQL database to store account and board info.</p>
				<p>This project is currently in progress but the code can be found at the <a href="https://github.com/bransonl/bulletin">Github repository</a>.</p>

				<h1>alisonlee.co</h1>
				<p><a href="http://alisonlee.co">alisonlee.co</a> is a website developed for a graphic designer to showcase their portfolio of work. As the graphic designer did not have the desire to learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript to develop and maintain their own website, I developed a system using which the graphic designer can easily add to, update or remove their work from the website, much like a CMS but significantly simpler. All file modifications are done by the designer on the server where the files are hosted.</p>
				<p>The system depends on a certain organization of files on the server, a file to determine the selection and order of work shown, and files to determine the order in which the content for each piece of work is displayed in the additional write-up for each piece. Using these files, the client-side JavaScript systematically retrieves the corresponding files from the server and places them onto the DOM in the order specified by the designer</p>
				<p>The portfolio section of the website acts similarly to a SPA. The "single page" aspects are implemented with only DOM manipulation using JavaScript with the JQuery library since a larger framework such as AngularJS would be unnecessary for the amount of content presented and the limited features of the website.</p>
